## Tutorial and Usage
After installing the plugins in your Eclipse IDE open the workspace and import the projects.

You can run the instantiation program by right-clicking in the file with ".sacm2", opening the popup menu, and selecting "ACEditor MBAC > Instantiate SACM 2.2 Model". The instantiation runs on EMF model files. After instantiation you can right click in the output file and select "Initialize sacm2_diagram diagram file". This will create a model compatible with eclipse GMF. 

In the diagram view, it is possible to navigate inside a package by "double click". For all elements a popup menu "ACEditor" is available after right-clicking on a model element whit the option "Show Element View". This opens a powerful dialog for viewing and editing model elements' properties.
